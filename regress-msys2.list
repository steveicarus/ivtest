# Format of the file
#
# testname		testtype		directory
#
# The <testname> is the verilog file name minus an extension.
#
# The <testtype> can be one of the following:
#
# normal:  Normal results expected, i.e it should compile and execute
#          producing at least a single line with PASSED.
#
# CO:      Compile Only - Compile the file to the default output type.
#
# CN:      Compile Null - Compile with the null target. Similar to CO.
#
# CE:      Compile with Errors - We EXPECT errors - we're checking
#                                illegal syntax
#
# RE:      Runtime with Errors - We EXPECT errors - we're checking
#                                illegal syntax
#
# EF:      Expected Fail - We EXPECT this test to fail - only use
#                          with older versions of Icarus.
#
# TE:      Translation Error - We EXPECT the translated code to fail -
#                              only supported in the vlog95 checker.
#
# NI:      Not implemented. Only use for version specific tests.
#
# <directory> is where the <testname>.v file is located.
#
# An optional fourth and fifth argument can be supplied.
#
# The fourth argument may be one of the following.
#
#   modulename                       - Defines the top level module
#   gold=filename                    - Compare a gold file against the
#                                      generated log file.
#   unordered=filename               - Compare a gold file against the
#                                      generated log file, allowing for lines
#                                      to appear in any order
#   diff=filename1:filename2:skip_ln - Compare the two files for equality.
#                                      Skip the first <skip_ln> lines or none.
#
# If a <modulename> is given you can supply a fifth argument for the
# gold or diff commands.
#

# Warning about non-existent /tmp directory
