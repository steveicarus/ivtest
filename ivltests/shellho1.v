/****************************************************************************

   The following code illustrates an apparent bug in the VCS v5.2 simulator.
   The check for whether or not the memory[0] array element was set correctly
   fails; yet the $display statement immediately after the check shows the
   memory[0] element actually has been set correctly.

   I've noted that if the $display and the check are reversed, the $display
   is incorrect but the check passes.

   This appears to be a problem with the simulator's internal scheduler.
